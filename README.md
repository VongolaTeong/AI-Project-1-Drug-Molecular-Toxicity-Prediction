<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is the individual project of CS410 Artificial Intelligence 2020 Fall in Shanghai Jiao Tong University
named Drug Molecular Toxicity Prediction. Given a dataset of drug molecules
and labels of their toxicity, develop a Deep Neural Network which can 
learn from the data provided and predict the toxicity of other molecules.
